# Project Name

Attendance Tracker

## Short Explanation

The program has a complete students list from 8th to 12th grade which means the program is meant for a high school after 7th grade. Only having 2 subclasses which are "a" and "b" (8a, 8b, ..., 12a, 12b).
Major use of functions and "while" cycles to imitate a real time app where only the user can exit the app and unless the user chooses to, the app will not close with prepared conditions to prevent errors. 

## How to use

When the program is ran it will offer information about the Total amount of absences in the high school and have the Maine menu display bellow the info. To use the program the user must enter 1 of 2 choises either "1" or "2" to use start with 1 using the app and showing the classes from 8 to 12 grade and option 2 which closes the app. After which you will be presented with choises from 1-6 where 1-5 are the classes 
and 6 is the Return button. Choosing a class will present the user with a choise between subclass either "a" or "b" for the class which was chosen before that. After selecting the class and subclass wanted from the user he will see a list of students from the specific 
class selected and can choose a students to change their number of absences by typing their number in class otherwise the useer can just press Enter to Return to the Main Menu with the 2 options from the begining. Selecting a students will ask you if you would like to 
chnage their absences as confirmation and will display the name and class of the students to make sure that's the correct person you want to work with and if so you can press "1" to change their absences which will activated 2 actions. First it will change the value of 
the absences in the program (students.ots) and the second action is to copy the infromation from the new Students structor massive and rewrite the txt file which is the infromation used for the students (which also is prepared in advance with 250 students with every class 
having 25 students). So even after closing the program the amount of absences a student has will be saved and can be used after closing the app. In case of a mistake and accidental deleation of the students.txt file there is a spare copy with the original data.
